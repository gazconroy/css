            <h1>My first blog post</h1>
            <h2>This is my blog post</h2>

            <p class="main-text">I will give you a complete account of the system,
                and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
                happiness. No
                one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
                but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
                extremely
                painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it
                is pain,
                but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
                To take
                a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
                advantage from
                it?</p>

                He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                brown belly, slightly domed
                and divided by arches into stiff sections.<br>
                The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
                pitifully thin
                compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.<br>
                "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little
                too
                small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on
                the
                table -
                Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
                illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
                fur boa
                who sat upright,
                raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned
                to look
                out the window at the dull weather.</p>
